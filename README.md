# Frontend_Teste_EaiPago_2025
This repository is for a test passed by Eai-Pago, second semester of 2025, for frontend dev.

There is one folder missing in this repository for the project to work, the "node_modules", usually when planning on running react/node applications you will already have this folder, github did not let me update such as immense folder, lot of archives. If in any doubt, contact me please.

To install the "node_modules" you can run on the terminal of Visual Studio Code "npm i --force", which will install the aforementioned folder.
